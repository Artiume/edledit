edledit is a program to edit Edit Decision Lists (EDL) files.

(C) 2010 Stephane Bidoul

The EDL file format is documented as part of the mplayer documentation:
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html. It is also used by the XBMC
media center as described there:
http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=EDL_(commercial_skipping)_and_SceneMarker_support

Limitations:
- the only EDL action supported by edledit is Cut (0).
- the EDL file must have the same name as the movie file, with the extension
  replaced with .edl
