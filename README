edledit is a GUI program to create and edit Edit Decision Lists (EDL) files.

mkvedlmerge is a program to cut a mkvfile according to an EDL and merge into a
new mkvfile, removing the skipped parts.

The EDL file format is documented as part of the mplayer documentation:
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html. It is also used by the XBMC
media center as described there:
http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=EDL_(commercial_skipping)_and_SceneMarker_support

Limitations:
- the EDL file must have the same name as the movie file, with the extension
  replaced with .edl
- the format defined in the MPlayer documentation is supported; XBMC extensions
  are not supported
- EDL blocks must not overlap and must be in chronological order; strange
  things may happen if you try to open an edl file which does not respect this
